E2.3
i. 4 vertices and 7 edges.

ii. Informally: It is not possible to find a path which visits each of the landmasses while only crossing each bridge once because the parallel bridges bring you back to a landmass with no feasible exit.

iii. Adding a third parallel bridge to either of the rivers with two parallel bridges would allow you top visit each landmass while only crossing each bridge once. I can't find a solution where there are only parallel bridges with even counts. I believe that there must be an odd number of bridges in at least one of the parallel set ups.

E2.9
i.

convex / non-convex:
for each vertex in a given polygon (proceeding around the polygon in a given direction):
    measure the angle from the segment ahead of to the segment behind the vertex
    if the angle is less than \pi:
        classify the vertex as convex
    otherwise:
        classify the vertex as non-convex

vertex type (i - vi):
for each vertex in a given polygon (in any order):
    if the vertex is convex:
        if the vertex's x-coordinate is less than both of the x-coordinates of its two segments (left/left):
            classify the vertex as type "i"
        if the vertex's x-coordinate is more than both of the x-coordinates of its two segments (right/right):
            classify the vertex as type "iii"
        otherwise (left/right):
            classify the vertex as type "v"
    if the vertex is non-convex:
        if the vertex's x-coordinate is less than both of the x-coordinates of its two segments (left/left):
            classify the vertex as type "ii"
        if the vertex's x-coordinate is more than both of the x-coordinates of its two segments (right/right):
            classify the vertex as type "iv"
        otherwise (left/right):
            classify the vertex as type "vi"
